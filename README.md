# BLACKJACK-GAME

Blackjack is the American variant of a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One.
It is a comparing card game between one player and a dealer, where player competes against the dealer
It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
1) Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a \"blackjack\"), without a dealer blackjack;
2) Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21
3) Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 (\"busted\").
The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10).\nFace cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven.

Rules of play:
The players' object is to win money by creating card totals that turn out to be higher than the dealer's\nhand but do not exceed 21, or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she busts.
On their turn, players must choose whether to \"HIT\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn)
After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the\nhand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11,\nalso known as a \"soft 17\",must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others).
